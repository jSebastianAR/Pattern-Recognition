# Pattern-Recognition
Repository of all the practices and exams for Pattern Recognition subject.

Practice 1 - Euclidean classifier. 

Practice 2 - Mahalanobis classifier(also contains Practice 1).

Practice 3 - Bayesian classifier(also contains Practices 1 & 2).

Practice 4 - KNN classifier(also contains Practices 1,2 & 3), in version 2 of this practice it's included the Object-oriented programming.

Practice 5 - This practice is about how we can evaluate a classifier, there are three forms in this practice.

1-reSustitution.
2-CrossValidation.
3-LeaveOneOut.

Practice 6 - Perceptron solving gate AND in 3D.

Practice 7 - Hierarchical clustering using Euclidean Distance.

Practice 8(also contains practice 7 and practices 1-5) - KMeans algorithm, there are two versions:

Version 1 - Plot the samples of the group around an specific point of the color on the country's flag.
Version 2 - Plot the samples of the group above all the specific color of that sample, this is the best version because we dont force to plot the samples at a specific point.

Practice 9 - Use Chain Rule with an umbral to classfify and create new groups, this practice contains a "random samples" option who able us to get a higher number of samples and use them to classify.

Practice 10 - An extension of Practice 8 using Lloyd Algorithm.
